# 💹 AI Financial Agent – LLM-Powered Financial Assistant

An intelligent, interactive AI agent that answers financial and stock-related queries using OpenAI’s GPT and mock financial data. Built with FastAPI for speed and simplicity.

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

- ✅ **LLM + Domain Data Fusion**: Combines the reasoning power of GPT with structured financial datasets.
- 🧠 **Conversational Financial Assistant**: Ask real-time questions like "What's AAPL’s market cap?" and get smart, context-rich answers.
- ⚡ **FastAPI-Powered API**: Production-grade performance with automatic docs (Swagger & ReDoc).
- 📈 **Mock Financial Intelligence**: Simulates realistic stock metrics—ideal for prototypes and investor AI research.
- 🔌 **Plug & Play Ready**: Easily upgrade to real data from Yahoo Finance, Polygon.io, or Financial Modeling Prep.
- ☁️ **Cloud-Deployable**: Designed to be deployed on Vercel, Render, or AWS in minutes.
